                "Currently, synchronize is limited to elevating permissions via passwordless sudo.  This is because rsync itself is connecting to the remote machine and rsync doesn't give us a way to pass sudo credentials in.",
                "Currently there are only a few connection types which support synchronize (ssh, paramiko, local, and docker) because a sync strategy has been determined for those connection types.  Note that the connection for these must not need a password as rsync itself is making the connection and rsync does not provide us a way to pass a password to the connection.",

Those synchronizing large numbers of files that are willing to trade safety for performance should call rsync directly.",
