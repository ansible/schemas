                "Manages TCL iApp templates on a BIG-IP. This module allows you to deploy iApp templates to the BIG-IP and manage their lifecycle. The conventional way to use this module is to import new iApps as needed, or by extracting the contents of the iApp archive that is provided at downloads.f5.com, and then importing all the iApps with this module. This module can also update existing iApps provided the source of the iApp changed while the name stayed the same. Note that this module will not reconfigure any services that may have been created using the C(bigip_iapp_service) module. iApps are normally not updated in production. Instead, new versions are deployed and then existing services are changed to consume that new template. As such, the ability to update templates in-place requires using the C(force) option."
