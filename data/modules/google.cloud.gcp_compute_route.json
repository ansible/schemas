                "A route is a rule that specifies how certain packets should be handled by the virtual network. Routes are associated with virtual machines by tag, and the set of routes for a particular virtual machine is called its routing table. For each packet leaving a virtual machine, the system searches that virtual machine's routing table for a single best matching route.",
                "Routes match packets by destination IP address, preferring smaller or more specific ranges over larger ones. If there is a tie, the system selects the route with the smallest priority value. If there is still a tie, it uses the layer three and four packet headers to select just one of the remaining matching routes. The packet is then forwarded as specified by the next_hop field of the winning route -- either to another virtual machine destination, a virtual machine gateway or a Compute Engine-operated gateway. Packets that do not match any route in the sending virtual machine's routing table will be dropped.",
