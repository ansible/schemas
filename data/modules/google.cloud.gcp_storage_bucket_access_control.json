WRITERs are READERs, and they can insert objects into the bucket and delete the bucket's objects. OWNERs are WRITERs, and they can get the acl property of a bucket, update a bucket, and call all BucketAccessControls methods on the bucket. For more information, see Access Control, with the caveat that this API uses READER, WRITER, and OWNER instead of READ, WRITE, and FULL_CONTROL."
