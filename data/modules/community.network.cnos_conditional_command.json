                "This module allows you to modify the running configuration of a switch. It provides a way to execute a single CNOS command on a network device by evaluating the current running configuration and executing the command only if the specific settings have not been already configured. The CNOS command is passed as an argument of the method. This module functions the same as the cnos_command module. The only exception is that following inventory variable can be specified [\"condition = <flag string>\"] When this inventory variable is specified as the variable of a task, the command is executed for the network element that matches the flag string. Usually, commands are executed across a group of network devices. When there is a requirement to skip the execution of the command on one or more devices, it is recommended to use this module. This module uses SSH to manage network device configuration."
