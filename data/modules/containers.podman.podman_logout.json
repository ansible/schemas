If the registry is not specified, the first registry under `[registries.search]` from `registries.conf `will be used. The path of the authentication file can be overridden by the user by setting the `authfile` flag. The default path used is `${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}/containers/auth.json`. All the cached credentials can be removed by setting the `all` flag. Warning - podman will use credentials in `${HOME}/.docker/config.json` to authenticate in case they are not found in the default `authfile`. However, the logout command will only removed credentials in the `authfile` specified."

This can be ignored by setting `ignore_docker_credentials` to `yes` - the credentials will be kept and `changed` will be false.
