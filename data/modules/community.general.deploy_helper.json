A release is a complete build of the application being\n# deployed. This can be a clone of a repository for example, or a sync of a local folder on your filesystem.\n# Having timestamped folders is one way of having distinct releases, but you could choose your own strategy like\n# git tags or commit hashes.\n#\n# During a deploy, a new folder should be created in the releases folder and any build steps required should be\n# performed. Once the new build is ready, the deploy procedure is 'finalized' by replacing the 'current' symlink\n# with a link to this build.\n#\n# The 'shared' folder holds any resource that is shared between releases. Examples of this are web-server\n# session files, or files uploaded by users of your application. It's quite common to have symlinks from a release\n# folder pointing to a shared/subfolder, and creating these links would be automated as part of the build steps.\n#\n# The 'current' symlink points to one of the releases. Probably the latest one, unless a deploy is in progress.\n# The web-server's root for the project will go through this symlink, so the 'downtime' when switching to a new\n# release is reduced to the time it takes to switch the link.\n#\n# To distinguish between successful builds and unfinished ones, a file can be placed in the folder of the release\n# that is currently in progress. The existence of this file will mark it as unfinished, and allow an automated\n# procedure to remove it during cleanup.\n\n\n# Typical usage\n- name: Initialize the deploy root and gather facts\n  community.general.deploy_helper:\n    path: /path/to/root\n- name: Clone the project to the new release folder\n  ansible.builtin.git:\n    repo: ansible.builtin.git://foosball.example.org/path/to/repo.git\n    dest: '{{ deploy_helper.new_release_path }}'\n    version: v1.1.1\n- name: Add an unfinished file, to allow cleanup on successful finalize\n  ansible.builtin.file:\n    path: '{{ deploy_helper.new_release_path }}/{{ deploy_helper.unfinished_filename }}'\n    state: touch\n- name: Perform some build steps, like running your dependency manager for example\n  composer:\n    command: install\n    working_dir: '{{ deploy_helper.new_release_path }}'\n- name: Create some folders in the shared folder\n  ansible.builtin.file:\n    path: '{{ deploy_helper.shared_path }}/{{ item }}'\n    state: directory\n  with_items:\n    - sessions\n    - uploads\n- name: Add symlinks from the new release to the shared folder\n  ansible.builtin.file:\n    path: '{{ deploy_helper.new_release_path }}/{{ item.path }}'\n    src: '{{ deploy_helper.shared_path }}/{{ item.src }}'\n    state: link\n  with_items:\n      - path: app/sessions\n        src: sessions\n      - path: web/uploads\n        src: uploads\n- name: Finalize the deploy, removing the unfinished file and switching the symlink\n  community.general.deploy_helper:\n    path: /path/to/root\n    release: '{{ deploy_helper.new_release }}'\n    state: finalize\n\n# Retrieving facts before running a deploy\n- name: Run 'state=query' to gather facts without changing anything\n  community.general.deploy_helper:\n    path: /path/to/root\n    state: query\n# Remember to set the 'release' parameter when you actually call 'state=present' later\n- name: Initialize the deploy root\n  community.general.deploy_helper:\n    path: /path/to/root\n    release: '{{ deploy_helper.new_release }}'\n    state: present\n\n# all paths can be absolute or relative (to the 'path' parameter)\n- community.general.deploy_helper:\n    path: /path/to/root\n    releases_path: /var/www/project/releases\n    shared_path: /var/www/shared\n    current_path: /var/www/active\n\n# Using your own naming strategy for releases (a version tag in this case):\n- community.general.deploy_helper:\n    path: /path/to/root\n    release: v1.1.1\n    state: present\n- community.general.deploy_helper:\n    path: /path/to/root\n    release: '{{ deploy_helper.new_release }}'\n    state: finalize\n\n# Using a different unfinished_filename:\n- community.general.deploy_helper:\n    path: /path/to/root\n    unfinished_filename: README.md\n    release: '{{ deploy_helper.new_release }}'\n    state: finalize\n\n# Postponing the cleanup of older builds:\n- community.general.deploy_helper:\n    path: /path/to/root\n    release: '{{ deploy_helper.new_release }}'\n    state: finalize\n    clean: False\n- community.general.deploy_helper:\n    path: /path/to/root\n    state: clean\n# Or running the cleanup ahead of the new deploy\n- community.general.deploy_helper:\n    path: /path/to/root\n    state: clean\n- community.general.deploy_helper:\n    path: /path/to/root\n    state: present\n\n# Keeping more old releases:\n- community.general.deploy_helper:\n    path: /path/to/root\n    release: '{{ deploy_helper.new_release }}'\n    state: finalize\n    keep_releases: 10\n# Or, if you use 'clean=false' on finalize:\n- community.general.deploy_helper:\n    path: /path/to/root\n    state: clean\n    keep_releases: 10\n\n# Removing the entire project root folder\n- community.general.deploy_helper:\n    path: /path/to/root\n    state: absent\n\n# Debugging the facts returned by the module\n- community.general.deploy_helper:\n    path: /path/to/root\n- ansible.builtin.debug:\n    var: deploy_helper\n",
