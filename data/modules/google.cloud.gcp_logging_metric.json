The argument are 1. field - The name of the log entry field from which the value is to be extracted. 2. regex - A regular expression using the Google RE2 syntax (U(https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax)) with a single capture group to extract data from the specified log entry field. The value of the field is converted to a string before applying the regex. It is an error to specify a regex that does not include exactly one capture group."
