                "This module allows you to work with switch configurations. It provides a way to roll back configurations of a switch from a remote server. This is achieved by using startup or running configurations of the target device that were previously backed up to a remote server using FTP, SFTP, TFTP, or SCP. The first step is to create a directory from where the remote server can be reached. The next step is to provide the full file path of he backup configuration's location. Authentication details required by the remote server must be provided as well. By default, this method overwrites the switch's configuration file with the newly downloaded file. This module uses SSH to manage network device configuration. The results of the operation will be placed in a directory named 'results' that must be created by the user in their local directory to where the playbook is run."
