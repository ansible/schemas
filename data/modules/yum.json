This caused problems when packages specified by filename or url had to be installed or removed together. In 1.9.2 this was fixed so that packages are installed in one yum transaction. However, if one of the packages adds a new yum repository that the other packages come from (such as epel-release) then that package needs to be installed in a separate task. This mimics yum's command line behaviour.",

Unfortunately, this division becomes apparent to ansible users because ansible needs to operate on the group of packages in a single transaction and yum requires groups to be specified in different ways when used in that way.  Package groups are specified as \"@development-tools\" and environment groups are \"@^gnome-desktop-environment\". Use the \"yum group list hidden ids\" command to see which category of group the group you want to install falls into.",
