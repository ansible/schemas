                "This module allows you to work with the running configuration of a switch. It provides a way to execute a set of CNOS commands on a switch by evaluating the current running configuration and executing the commands only if the specific settings have not been already configured. The configuration source can be a set of commands or a template written in the Jinja2 templating language. This module uses SSH to manage network device configuration. The results of the operation will be placed in a directory named 'results' that must be created by the user in their local directory to where the playbook is run."
