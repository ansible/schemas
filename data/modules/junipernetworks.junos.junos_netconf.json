                "This module provides an abstraction that enables and configures the netconf system service running on Junos devices.  This module can be used to easily enable the Netconf API. Netconf provides a programmatic interface for working with configuration and state resources as defined in RFC 6242. If the C(netconf_port) is not mentioned in the task by default netconf will be enabled on port 830 only."
